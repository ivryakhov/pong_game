# pong_game
It's a simple pong game created following by the Evan's [Making Pong](http://elm-lang.org/blog/making-pong) tutorial.

And some of the mentioned challenges are accepted:

* Make the Pong field look nicer. Add a line (or dotted line) at mid-field.
* Add the ability to pause the game during game play.
* Add the ability to reset the game (besides refreshing the page!).
